# Tableau-Project
Texas Electricity Analysis-

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project analyzes three years of data on Texas's electricity market to uncover the relationships between electricity prices, generation sources, load (demand), and weather conditions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that helps stakeholders understand key market dynamics and drivers of price fluctuations.

Objective: To analyze trends in electricity prices, generation, and load in Texas from 2019 to 2021, and to identify correlations with weather data.

Tools Used: Tableau Desktop, Tableau Prep, Excel, and various CSV files.

Key Metrics: Electricity Price, Total Load, Generation by Source (e.g., Solar, Wind, Coal), Temperature, and Humidity.


DATA SOURCES: 

The analysis is based on the following datasets, which were processed and prepared using Tableau Prep:

Electricity Prices (Elec_Prices_2019.csv, 2020.csv, 2021.csv): Contains hourly electricity price data.

Generation (Generation_2019.csv, 2020.csv, 2021.csv): Details the amount of electricity generated by different sources over time.

Load (Load_Aggregate_19_21.csv): Aggregated data on total electricity demand.

DASHBOARD & DESIGN ANALYSIS:

The interactive Tableau dashboard, saved as a .twbx file, is designed to provide multiple layers of insight. The key visualizations include:

1.Price and Load Trends: A line chart showing how electricity price and load have changed over the three-year period, with the ability to filter by date range.

2.Generation Mix Breakdown: A stacked bar chart or pie chart that visualizes the percentage of electricity contributed by each generation source (e.g., solar, wind, coal).

3.Weather Correlation: A scatter plot or line chart that demonstrates the relationship between weather variables (like temperature) and electricity price or load. This helps to confirm hypotheses about peak demand during hot seasons.

4.Geographical Map: A map of Texas that displays key metrics like average price or load by region, utilizing the provided shapefile for accurate visualization.

5.Weather (Weather_Combined_19_21.csv): Weather data for Texas, including temperature, humidity, and other relevant metrics.

6.Geographical (Region.shp): A shapefile used for geographic visualization within Tableau.
